password-generator - Homework assignment for 01/11/2021

---------------------------------------------------------

This week's assignment was to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected.

I started by simply changing the html, javaScript, and css file locations within my password-generator folder, so that the structure made more sense. index.html was previously in a separate folder, and would need to be at the base level to successfully deploy on GitHub.

Since my html and css documents were already written, I then jumped right in to editing my javaScript so that I could focus not he javaScript content. I decided that if I had additional time left over I might play with different color and styling combinations in css, but should focus on the purpose of the assignment first.

I started by defining as many variables as I could think of. I then started thinking about how to randomize each type of character (lowercase, capital, number and special character) and give the user an option of what they wish to include in their password. 

I then needed to find away to attach these selections to the radio buttons I added to the HTML and return a Boolean. I also added a "number" input in the html, where the user could decide how long they wanted their password to be. I used console.log to display these variables and make sure they were working properly.

From here, I got a little but stuck, and decided to play around with formatting in CSS to give the site more character and give my brain a rest. I added a background, played with text colors, and borders, and made the button a little more dynamic by changing :hover and :active attributes.

Once I had taken a bit of a breather and felt like the site was looking nice, I went back to the javaScript and finished up as mush as I could. You may be grading this before I was able to get the javaScript fully working, however I'm still in the process of asking for help touching up the final results.
